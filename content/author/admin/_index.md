I am PhD candidate at the Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences (GESS) and research associate at the Chair for Political Economy at the University of Mannheim. Currently I am also working as research associate at the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research in the Project "Experiences of Everyday Racism and Media-Mediated Racism in the (Political) Public Sphere".

My research focuses on **committee decision making** and **lobbying**. I am especially interested in **strategic information provision** and the effect of **behavioral information processing** on decision making. In my research I use **formal models, experiments and quantitative methods**, particularly **quantitative text analysis methods**. I am also interested in social media usage on electoral campaigning and social preferences more generally.
